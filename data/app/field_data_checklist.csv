B722	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		Grotto Beach	San Salvador			At Grotto Beach, the LIG outcrop extends from the island-ward limit of the modern beach and stretches across the grotto. Immediatly adjacent to the modern beach is a paleo-patch reef containing *Porites astreoides*, *Psuedodiploria sp.* and *Montastrea sp.*. Around 2.5 m above MSL these framework corals are capped by a thin layer (10-20 cm) of corraline red algae (*Neogoniolithon Strictum*). Above, there are 1.5 meters of cross bedded and very poorly sorted (medium to pebble sized) angular carbonate sand. This sand unit is capped by intermittent breccia intra-clasts that transition upwards into well-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm-thin beds that dip towards the paleo-coastline. These nearly parallel-bedded sands persist up to at least 5.8 meters where bedding becomes difficult to discern. The upper-most sediments here have abundant root-casts and are mostly very fine sand (likely aeolian). Hattin and Warren 1989 contains an detailed description and interpretation of this outcrop.			 there are 1.5 meters of cross and very poorly sorted (medium to pebble sized) angular carbonate sand. This sand unit is capped by intermittent breccia intra+AC0-clasts where it transitions upwards into well+AC0-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm+AC0-thin beds that dip towards the paleo+AC0-coastline. These nearly parallel+AC0-bedded sands persist up to at least 5.8 meters where bedding becomes difficult to discern. The upper+AC0-most sediments here have abundant root+AC0-casts and are mostly very fine sand (presumably aeolian).
B729	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		Clifton Pier	New Providence			"Exposed along the cliffs of the southwest corner of New Providence Island there are excellent exposures of a last interglacial shallowing-upwards parasequences. The lower 2.5 m contain large (>50 cm) scale trough-cross stratification and intraclast breccia blocks (roughly 50 cm diameter). The intraclasts disappear upwards and the cross bed scale decreases slightly up to about meter 4.5 where the cross stratification transitions into 10-20 cm tabular cross beds. Further upwards, sparse tabular clasts mark the transition from this unit into roughly 2 meters of well-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm-thin beds that dip towards the paleo-coastline. The outcrop is capped by very fine sand that has abundant fossilized root-casts. This unit is described in detail by Aurell et. al. 1995 and many others (Garrett and Gould 1984, Ball 1967, Strasser and Davaud 1986).

"			 you can find excellent exposures of a last interglacial shallowing+AC0-upwards parasequence. The lower 2.5 m contain large (+AD4-50 cm) scale trough+AC0-cross stratification and intra+AC0-clast breccia blocks (roughly 50 cm diameter). The intra+AC0-clasts disappear and the cross bed scale decreases slightly up to about meter 4.5 where the cross stratification transitions into 10+AC0-20 cm tabular cross beds. There are some tabular clasts that mark the upwards transition from this unit into roughly 2 meters of well+AC0-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm+AC0-thin beds that dip towards the paleo+AC0-coastline.

B801	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		Boat Cove	West Caicos			This outcrop is part of an extensive exposure of a LIG reef that spans most of West Caicos island. At this location, the lowermost 2 m is a heavily recrystallized framework of in-situ corals (*Acrapora Palmata* and *Psuedodiploria sp.*). Those corals are capped by 2 m of large-scale (50 cm) cross stratification and abundant *Ophiomorpha* trace fossils (likely shrimp burrows). This cross stratified unit sharply transitions upwards into ~1 m of well-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm-thin beds that dip towards the paleo-coastline. The ocean-ward edge of these nearly parallel beds often contain tabular breccia blocks of the same unit (possibly ancient beach rock breccia). This unit is capped with intermittently spaced (10-20 meter) large breccia-filled 'flower-pots'. These features are 1-2 meter diameter round bowl-shaped depressions carved downward into the subplanar beds. Each 'pot' is filled with bright red limestone that contains clasts of recrystallized grey or black limestone. These features may indicate the past location of large plants or palm trees. Kerans et al 2019 contains more detailed descriptions of the outcrop on West Caicos.			
B815	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		Matthew Town	Great Inagua			"In central Matthew Town, the coastal outcrop consists of a last interglacial shallowing-upwards parasequence. The lowermost meter contains abundant large-scale (50 cm) cross stratification and *Ophiomorpha* trace fossils. There is an irregular contact between this cross bedded facies and the overlying facies that consists of well-sorted sands that are arranged in nearly parallel mm-thin beds that dip towards the paleo-coastline. The top of this well-sorted unit contains a 5-8 cm thick deposit with pervasive and irregular cm-scale macro-porosity. This porous unit has been interpreted as a wrack-line or plant accumulation layer at the contact between beach and dunes White and Curran 1987. The upper-most rocks in this location contain very fine sand, and are full of fossilized root-casts.

B1111	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Long Cay	Crooked Island			Roughly 30 km south of Landrail Point along the western margin of Long Cay there is outcrop of a last interglacial progradational strandplain that extends for 4.5 km. The lower 3 m of this sequence contains large-scale (50 cm) cross stratification and abundant *Ophiomorpha* trace fossils (likely shrimp burrows). This lower unit contains occasional thumb-sized coral fragments (*Siderastrea Radians*). There is an irregular and gradual contact between this lower facies and an overlying facies that consists of approximately 2 meters of well-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm-thin beds that dip towards the paleo-coastline. The upper-most part of this unit contains extremely well preserved spherical beach fenestrae (the remnants of air escaping when waves crashed on the ancient beach). Above this fenestrae-bearing beach facies, there are large meter scale fossilized aeolinite dunes. The dune height varies along the 4.5 km coastal outcrop from half a meter to more than 3 meters.			
B1124	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes	Yes		Old Greyâ€™s	Long Island			"North east of Anderson's settlement on Long Island there is outcrop of a last interglacial fossil reef that extends for 400 m. On the northern end of this reef, the modern coastline bends westward, and around that bend there is a 3 m high shallowing-upwards parasequence. The lower meter contains large-scale (50 cm) cross stratification. The contact between this lower unit and the overlying unit is difficult to pinpoint. The overlying unit contains well-sorted sands with nearly parallel mm-thin beds that dip towards the paleo-coastline, and the upper-most beds in this unit contain well preserved spherical beach fenestrae.
